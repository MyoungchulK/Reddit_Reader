So you can follow up on him too.\\n\\nEDIT: Note the comments below. sir\\\\_axolotl\\\\_alot first writes he is NOT a real admin. THEN he edits it to say he is an admin (after successfully applying). So this is a coverup, backtracking to fix his previous activities. His account was made within a few weeks of sending the messages, while the game was made a long time ago. So his account was made just to spam the google doc messages. Also, there is a polling function in reddit released more than 5 years ago. Making you go to google doc, they can track email accounts you use and sometimes embed links to webpages that break out of the browser sandbox to get in your computer\\n\\n\\\\[–\\\\]from\\xa0[sir\\\\_axolotl\\\\_alot](https://www.reddit.com/user/sir_axolotl_alot)\\\\[A\\\\]\\xa0sent\\xa02 days ago\\n\\nHi!\\n\\n\\xa0here, admin from Reddit’s Developer Platform team.
